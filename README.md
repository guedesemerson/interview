# FullStack_Interview

Goal: 
We would like you to push your known knowledge bounds and attempt to create a simple "full-stack" application using novel technologies. We request that your final submission is clearly documented (both in a clear README.md file as well as functional level code commenting) and deployable on any platform. We will outline the basic requirements below. 

Objective: 

Make a containorized application that performs the following objectives. 
-Application should be containorized using a docker image and deployable on any platform. 
- Checks the raw datasets provided for formattings, structure, and identifies common fields. 
- Links the raw datasets by key attributes for an integrated dataset. 
- Stores the integrated dataset in a common data model/data warehouse for use
- Create a web application backend using Python's Flask library
- Create a simple front-end (web-browser) viewer of the integrated dataset that has the following features. 
-- A map (e.g., leaflet, Mapbox) displaying the integrated dataset
-- Simple interactivity to display the attributes (beyond the spatial location) of the data points on-click.
